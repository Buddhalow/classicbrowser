# ClassicBrowser (a.k.a. Flashback Browser)
By Alexander Forselius <alexander.forselius@buddhalow.com>

A simple web browser written in WinForms .NET that emulates how Internet Explorer looked during the 90s. Ironically, it uses CefSharp (ChromiumEmbedded.NET) as the underlying rendering engine.

# Known issues

* The address field sometimes disappear on start or resizing, probaly because it does overflow.
* Not all buttons are implemented

# TODO

* Implement favorites (Store favorites in a database)

* Add custom stylesheet on browsing so web pages looks more like in the 90s (Force all fonts to be Arial, grey background, remove css etc.)
